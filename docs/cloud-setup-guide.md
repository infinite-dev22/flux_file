Cloud Setup Guide

This project contains placeholders for multiple cloud providers (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, SFTP).

Steps (generic):
1. Create API credentials at your provider.
2. Store credentials securely (environment variables or config files not checked into VCS).
3. Implement the corresponding adapter and auth handler.
